[04:31:28] <Taffer> it's on iphone too
[04:32:49] <Chaosteil> greetings
[04:33:38] <Chaosteil> would like to dicuss this weeks post
[04:33:58] <Chaosteil> have not tried uniwar, maybe someday, currently I'm hacking away at my phone, so games don't work that well
[04:35:18] <Taffer> let me know,i got it awhile ago. But I got an sc2 pro to play with me so I will get my ass kicked
[04:35:29] <Taffer> tomorrow
[04:35:31] <Taffer> I should be sleeping
[04:35:38] <Taffer> Game breaking builds
[04:36:04] <Taffer> solo or group, can use henchmen if need be
[04:36:48] <Chaosteil> I thought rather 4 dude team
[04:37:19] <Chaosteil> what combinations can users come up with, which skill trees and style of play is going to be viable in hell in a 4 player team
[04:37:24] <Taffer> can be either really. 4 team has lots of potential though
[04:37:33] <Chaosteil> yeah, because it's easy to get into\
[04:37:45] <Chaosteil> you just need to fire up the build calculator a few times
[04:38:01] <Taffer> yeah :D so link to it and have an example ready in your post
[04:38:25] <Chaosteil> game breaking builds would rather require in-depth analysis, which we should go for once we have an established base of "discusseers"
[04:38:32] <Taffer> it will be hard, but try to leave gear out of the question and only focus on builds
[04:38:41] <Taffer> consitency
[04:38:50] <Chaosteil> yeah, I'll try
[04:38:54] <Taffer> you will :P
[04:39:12] <Chaosteil> what sc2 pro did you get?
[04:39:41] <Taffer> friend of mine, we play tribes and KF together. Atticus on Vile
[04:40:02] <Taffer> just got back from brazil
[04:40:14] <Chaosteil> woah cool
[04:45:17] <Taffer> so do you want to do less game breaking and more about making the perfect team comp?
[04:46:24] <Taffer> btw, I am thinking of some sort of special flair, might be able to do something not for this one but soon(blizzard time) to reward good posters in taking part of the discussion
[04:46:37] <Taffer> to encourage more discussion
[04:46:50] <Taffer> I will make a post in your post about it on friday
[04:53:49] <Taffer> also http://www.elderscrolls.com/?adam
[05:06:19] <Chaosteil> perfect team I think, bigger audience
[05:06:27] <Taffer> kk
[05:06:36] <Chaosteil> though as I said way previously, I'm currently in the process of finding game breaking builds myself
[05:06:38] <Chaosteil> so maybe next time
[05:07:00] <Chaosteil> just edit the boilerplate text in the file with you flair idea
[05:07:49] <Taffer> same doc file?
