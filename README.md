Bip to Energymech
=================

This is a python script that converts the IRC logs generated by the [Bip IRC bouncer](http://bip.milkypond.org/) to the Energymech format used by [ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/).

The reason for this converter is to enable logs generated by Bip to be used with [pisg](http://pisg.sourceforge.net/) for stats building.
